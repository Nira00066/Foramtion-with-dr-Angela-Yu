<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Nina Lopez. I just started learning web development with the course by Angela Yu.</br>
  Fortunately, with a lot of work, I got accepted into a coding school three months later, with Simplon in Bayonne, France.</br>
</p>

<p>Professionally, I started studying at a fashion school in Saint Jean de Luz, where I spent four years.</br>
  When I finished my studies, I decided to move to an English-speaking country to improve my vocabulary and also to live my life.</br>
  It might seem radical at 21 years old to go alone to another country when you've never ventured that far away before, but it was the best way to figure out what I liked or not.</br>
  And now, I've found what I want to do!
</p>

<p>"If you're looking for an intern in development, then I'm that person. Determined to learn from you and improve my skills!"</p>
